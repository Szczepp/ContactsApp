# ContactsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.7.

It contains 2 components:
* contact-list (used to display contact list)
* contact   (used to display contact details)

I used bootstrap for styling and few js libraries like HttpClient to make requests.
Register/Login and Categories features are not implemented due to lack of time.

This is my ***first*** application ever in Angular, so I'm happy it works, even though I didn't implement every requirement.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
